**English** | [Русский](README.ru.md)

Browser-based SSH terminal. Plain HTTP, no build, no extra services.

- 📦 No npm, no pip — drop the files in and run
- 🌐 Corporate networks with only HTTPS open: works without WebSocket
- ⭐ Sessions survive tab close, reboot, and backend restart for up to 72 h (via tmux on the target host)

```

## How it works

Three pieces:

- **Browser.** xterm.js renders the terminal. Each keystroke goes up as a POST to `/api/input`.
- **websh host.** `server.py` runs each SSH connection as a PTY subprocess and streams output back over Server-Sent Events on `/api/stream`. The same process serves the frontend, so you don't need a separate web server.
- **Remote.** The host you SSH into. Optionally wrapped in tmux so the session survives reconnects.

If a proxy buffers SSE (some shared hosts do), the client falls back to long-polling on `/api/output` for that session. Slower, but works.

Shared hosting that doesn't allow long-lived processes? Ship `api.php` next to `server.py`. The PHP shim starts the backend on the first request and proxies the API to it.

**Why not WebSocket?** Many shared-hosting PHP setups don't proxy it — websh has to drop in there too. SSE gives the same low latency on plain HTTP and tunnels through any HTTPS proxy without a protocol upgrade.

For deeper internals — buffer-detection probe, lost-byte handling on disconnect, local-echo prediction, selectors-based wait — see [`docs/sse-transport.md`](docs/sse-transport.md).

## Requirements

- **Backend.** Python 3.5+ with `ssh` in PATH. Stdlib only — no pip dependencies.
- **Browser.** Any modern browser. xterm.js is loaded from a CDN.
- **Optional shared-hosting proxy.** PHP 5.3+ with the `curl` extension.
- **Optional reverse proxy.** nginx, Caddy, or Apache.

## Highlights

### 🖥️ Terminal

Real xterm.js — copy-on-select, right-click paste, scrollback search (`Ctrl+Shift+F`), zoom (`Ctrl+±`), fullscreen (`F11`).

- Split panes, horizontal or vertical, with draggable dividers
- Pane switching with `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`
- Dark and light themes (persisted)
- Font picker (⚙) with live preview — JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, IBM Plex Mono, Roboto Mono, Source Code Pro, Inconsolata, or system default. Custom size, line-height, weight

### 🔁 Persistent sessions

Tick **Persistent session** at connect — websh wraps the shell in a tmux session on the target host. Close the tab, reboot, restart `server.py`: the pane re-attaches to the same tmux session with scrollback and running processes intact. See [Persistent sessions (tmux)](#persistent-sessions-tmux).

- Reconnect button on disconnect; red banner on auth failure
- URL anchors (`#connect=Production`) for direct links and bookmarks
- Saved connections in browser `localStorage`

### 📁 File transfer

Upload and download without `scp`.

- **Upload.** Pick files; the browser streams the bytes through a piggybacked SSH ControlMaster channel (`cat > $HOME/<tmp>`, no PTY, no base64, one HTTP POST per file). On persistent (tmux) panes the file is moved into `pane_current_path` automatically — vim/less/htop in the foreground stay untouched. Non-persistent panes type the `mv` into the foreground shell with an alt-screen guard. Auto-increment on name conflicts. Native xhr.upload progress, multi-file queue, cancel mid-flight.
- **Download.** Select a filename in the terminal, click Download.
- **Export scrollback.** Save the current buffer as a text file. Persistent panes pull the real tmux scrollback via `tmux capture-pane`.

### 🔐 Connection profiles

From free-form "type a host and go" to strictly allowlisted click-to-connect.

- Password and SSH key auth
- Server-side profiles in `websh.json` — credentials stay on the server; the browser never sees them
- **Ready** (saved creds) and **Prompt** (allowlisted target, user types own password) profile kinds
- `allowed_users` / `denied_users` per profile
- Per-profile SSH options (`ProxyJump`, `StrictHostKeyChecking`, …)
- `restrict_hosts: true` hides the free-form form entirely

### 🚀 Deployment

- **Shared hosting.** Upload 4 files + `assets/` via FTP; `api.php` starts the backend on demand. No SSH access to the host needed.
- **Python only.** The backend serves the frontend itself — zero extras.
- **Docker, systemd, reverse proxy.** Recipes included.
- Plain HTTP transport with automatic long-poll fallback for hosts that buffer SSE.

## Use cases

- **Corporate firewalls** — SSH port blocked, only HTTPS open. websh tunnels through standard HTTPS.
- **No native terminal** — Chromebooks, iPads, kiosks. Any browser becomes a terminal.
- **Customer access** — give a customer a browser link to their own server. URL anchors (`#connect=ServerName`) for direct links.
- **Bastion UI** — install websh on a jump host, reach internal servers from any browser.
- **Recovery from a foreign machine** — open a URL, you're in.
- **Workshops** — students don't install anything locally.

## Quick start (your machine)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dolonet/websh.git
cd websh
python3 server.py
```

Open http://localhost:8765 — that's it. No pip install, no npm, no build step.

Requires Python 3.5+ and `ssh` in your PATH. The server binds to
`127.0.0.1` by default; set `HOST=0.0.0.0` to expose it on the LAN.

## Quick start (shared hosting)

**No SSH access required.** Upload files via FTP, open in browser.

A typical shared hosting directory structure:

```
/home/user/
  example.com/              <- site root
    websh.json              <- config (OUTSIDE www — not accessible via HTTP)
    www/                    <- web root (public)
      console/
        index.html          <- frontend
        websh.js            <- frontend logic
        api.php             <- PHP proxy
        server.py           <- backend (auto-started by api.php)
        assets/             <- brand SVGs (logo, light/dark variants)
```

**Steps:**

1. Create a folder in your web root (e.g. `www/console/`)
2. Upload `index.html`, `websh.js`, `api.php`, `server.py`, and the `assets/` folder there
3. Open `https://your-host/console/` in a browser

That's it. `api.php` starts `server.py` automatically on the first request.

> **Path details:** `api.php` looks for `websh.json` two directories up from itself
> (i.e. the site root, above `www/`). This works for most hosting providers.
> If your layout is different, set the `WEBSH_CONFIG` environment variable
> or edit the path in `api.php` line 34.

### Troubleshooting

**"Backend unavailable" or blank page:**
- Check that Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`
- Check that `ssh` is available: `which ssh`
- Some shared hosts disable `exec()` in PHP — ask your hosting provider or check `phpinfo()`

**Config not loading:**
- Verify `websh.json` path — `api.php` looks two directories up by default
- Set `WEBSH_CONFIG=/full/path/to/websh.json` environment variable if your layout differs
- Check JSON syntax: `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('websh.json'))"`

**Port already in use:**
- Another instance of `server.py` may be running: `ps aux | grep server.py`
- Change the port: `PORT=8766 python3 server.py`

## Server-side connections (optional)

Pre-configure connections so users just click to connect — no passwords
on the client. Create `websh.json` in your **site root** (not in `www/`):

```json
{
  "restrict_hosts": false,
  "connections": [
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "host": "server.example.com",
      "port": 22,
      "username": "deploy",
      "password": "secret"
    }
  ]
}
```

See `websh.json.example` for a full example including SSH key auth and custom SSH options.

> **This file contains passwords — keep it outside the web root.**
> It must not be accessible via HTTP. If your hosting layout doesn't match
> the diagram above, set the `WEBSH_CONFIG` environment variable.

### Per-connection SSH options

Override default SSH behavior for specific connections:

```json
{
  "name": "Strict server",
  "host": "secure.example.com",
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "secret",
  "ssh_options": {
    "StrictHostKeyChecking": "yes",
    "ProxyJump": "bastion.example.com"
  }
}
```

### Connection kinds: Ready vs Prompt

Each `connections[]` entry is one of two kinds, auto-detected by whether
a `password` or `key` is present:

- **Ready** — credentials (`password` or `key`) are stored server-side.
  The user clicks the card and connects. The browser never sees the
  credentials.
- **Prompt** — no `password` and no `key`. The entry acts as an
  allowlisted target: the user clicks the card, the manual form appears
  pre-filled (host/port locked, username locked if fixed) and the user
  types their own password or key.

Prompt entries may carry optional `allowed_users` (whitelist) or
`denied_users` (blacklist) to restrict which usernames may connect.
`allowed_users` wins if both are set. These rules are ignored when the
entry has a fixed `username` (there's no choice to police). Saving the
typed credentials locally via the "Save this connection" checkbox works
the same as with the free manual form.

```json
{
  "name": "Shared DB",
  "host": "db.example.com",
  "port": 2222,
  "allowed_users": ["alice", "bob"]
}
```

### Restrict mode

Set `"restrict_hosts": true` to hide the free-form manual connection form
entirely. Users can only go through a configured connection card. Raw
manual-path POSTs to `/api/connect` (bypassing the UI) are also rejected.
With a single connection, the UI auto-selects it on load — Ready connects
immediately, Prompt surfaces the locked form ready for a password.

### Security note on user lists

`allowed_users` / `denied_users` apply only inside the **named** connection
flow (`{connection: "<name>"}` on `/api/connect`). When `restrict_hosts`
is off, the free manual form and raw manual-path POSTs are not bound by
those lists — they're a UX-guided allowlist for your team, not a hardening
boundary against a determined caller. Combine with `restrict_hosts: true`
if you need the rules to be enforced against direct API access too.

### Deny-list for free-form connect

When `restrict_hosts` is off (the default), visitors can target any host
they like. To stop the proxy from reaching internal infrastructure or
your own boxes, add a `denied_hosts` array:

```json
{
  "restrict_hosts": false,
  "denied_hosts": [
    "127.0.0.0/8",
    "10.0.0.0/8",
    "172.16.0.0/12",
    "192.168.0.0/16",
    "169.254.0.0/16",
    "fe80::/10",
    "evil.example",
    "your-internal-jumpbox.example.com"
  ]
}
```

Each entry is parsed as an IP address or CIDR network when possible
(IPv4 and IPv6 both supported); otherwise it's matched as an exact
hostname (case-insensitive). At connect time websh resolves the target
hostname via the system resolver and rejects the request if any of the
returned addresses fall inside a denied range — so a public-looking
domain whose A record points into RFC1918 is also blocked.

DNS resolution failures fail open (the request goes through; ssh's own
resolver will then fail with a clear error). Hosts you've put in
`connections` bypass the deny-list — explicit configuration wins.

### URL anchors

Link directly to a server-side connection:

```
https://your-host/console/#connect=Production
```

This auto-connects on page load — useful for bookmarks and support links.

## Persistent sessions (tmux)

Tick **Persistent session** on the connect form and the remote shell is
wrapped in a tmux session on the target host
(`tmux new-session -A -D -s websh-<slot>`). Close the tab, refresh the
page, or restart `server.py` — the pane re-attaches to the same session
with scrollback and running processes intact.

**Requirements.** `tmux` must be installed on the target (any recent
version). If it isn't, the connect flow surfaces a popup offering to
fall back to a short-lived (non-persistent) session instead.

**How reattach works.** Each persistent pane stores its slot id in
browser `localStorage` alongside the connection record. On refresh, the
frontend re-opens the pane with the same slot id and tmux re-attaches
you to the existing session. Slot ids are per pane instance — closing
a pane with `[x]` does not free the slot for reuse.

**Terminating a session.** Clicking `[x]` on a persistent pane pops a
confirm modal (Cancel / Terminate session / Terminate and never ask
again). "Terminate" sends `tmux kill-session` on the target before the
pane closes. If you just close the browser tab without terminating,
the session stays alive on the target and you can re-attach later.

**Idle-TTL watchdog.** At session creation, a detached POSIX-sh
watchdog is spawned alongside the shell. It polls tmux and kills the
session once it has been unattached for `WEBSH_TMUX_IDLE_TTL` seconds
(default 72 h; `0` disables). The watchdog reparents to init via
`nohup` and survives `server.py` restarts. Active (attached) sessions
refresh the clock each poll, so long-running work doesn't get reaped
just because you had a brief disconnect.

**Per-connect tmux options (Options panel).** Three toggles in the
Options panel ride along on every persistent connect via
`tmux new-session … \; set -g …` and are also pushed into running
panes the moment you change them, so the new behaviour takes effect
without a reconnect:

- **Mouse** — wheel scrolls tmux scrollback in shell; alt-screen
  apps (vim, less, htop) get raw mouse events. Hold Shift to bypass
  tmux selection and use the browser's native text selection instead.
- **Auto-copy** — `set-clipboard on`. tmux copy-mode selections are
  pushed to the system clipboard via OSC52 (xterm.js ships them on).
- **Scrollback** — `history-limit` (default 100 000). How many lines
  per pane tmux retains.

The server accepts these only via a fixed allow-list (`mouse`,
`set-clipboard`, `history-limit` clamped to 100..10 M); anything else
is silently dropped, so an out-of-date or hostile client can't
inject extra `set -g` lines.

These `set -g` lines run after the target's own `~/.tmux.conf` and
therefore override matching options there. Untick the toggles in the
Options panel if you'd rather your host-side config win.

**tmux status bar is hidden by default.** websh runs `set -g status
off` on every persistent attach. Multi-pane is handled by websh's
own splits (each pane is a separate SSH connection), not by tmux
windows, so the default status bar — slot-id session name, empty
window list, and a clock — is visual noise that just steals a row of
terminal real estate. To re-enable for a single session: `Ctrl+B
:set -g status on` (resets on next reconnect).

## Configuration

Environment variables for `server.py`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8765` | Listen port |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Idle timeout in seconds |
| `MAX_SESSIONS` | `50` | Max concurrent SSH sessions |
| `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_IP` | `0` | Max concurrent sessions per source IP (`0` disables; counts foreground + background together) |
| `WEBSH_CONFIG` | *(auto-detected)* | Path to `websh.json` config file |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | `127.0.0.1` | Comma-separated IPs to trust `X-Forwarded-For` from |
| `MAX_BG_SESSIONS` | `50` | Max background SSH sessions (file upload/download) |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` | `50` | Max `/api/connect` attempts per IP per window |
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` | `60` | Rate-limit window in seconds |
| `SCAN_PATTERN_THRESHOLD` | `0` | One IP that probes at least N distinct deny-listed targets in `SCAN_PATTERN_WINDOW` seconds gets `result=scan_pattern` events emitted starting on the Nth probe; `0` disables. ANY successful connect from the same IP clears state, so legitimate users never accumulate. |
| `SCAN_PATTERN_WINDOW` | `300` | Sliding window for scan-pattern detection, in seconds |
| `WEBSH_TMUX_IDLE_TTL` | `259200` | Seconds a detached persistent tmux session may idle on the target before it's reaped (default 72h, `0` disables) |
| `WEBSH_TMUX_WATCHDOG_POLL` | `300` | Seconds between idle-TTL watchdog checks on the target |
| `WEBSH_ACCESS_LOG` | *(unset)* | Path to a JSON-line access log; when unset, no access log is written. See [Access log](#access-log) below. |

The PHP proxy reads `WEBSH_PORT` (default `8765`) to find the backend.

## Deployment

### Shared hosting (PHP + Python)

Upload the four files (`index.html`, `websh.js`, `api.php`, `server.py`)
and the `assets/` folder (brand SVGs) to your web directory. The backend
starts automatically.

For manual control (e.g. custom config path):

```bash
WEBSH_CONFIG=/path/to/websh.json nohup python3 server.py &
```

### Python only (no PHP)

The backend can serve the frontend directly — no PHP or separate web server needed:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0 python3 server.py
```

Open `http://your-host:8765/` in a browser. The backend serves the static
files (`index.html`, `websh.js`, `assets/*.svg`) from the same directory as
`server.py`, and handles API requests on the same port. See
[HTTPS via reverse proxy](#https-via-reverse-proxy) below.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t websh .
docker run -d -p 8765:8765 -e HOST=0.0.0.0 websh
```

Open `http://localhost:8765/` — the backend serves the frontend directly. See
[HTTPS via reverse proxy](#https-via-reverse-proxy) below.

### systemd

```bash
# Create a dedicated user
useradd -r -s /bin/false websh

mkdir -p /opt/websh
cp server.py index.html websh.js /opt/websh/
cp websh.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl enable --now websh
```

### HTTPS via reverse proxy

Put nginx or Caddy in front for TLS termination:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name ssh.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8765;
        proxy_read_timeout 60s;

        # OVERWRITE the client-IP header with the real peer. Do not
        # append — a client can pre-populate X-Forwarded-For and bypass
        # per-IP rate limiting and the per-IP session cap if you
        # `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;`
        # (which appends). websh trusts only the first token.
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

`proxy_read_timeout` must comfortably exceed both the long-poll window
(10 s) and the SSE keep-alive interval (15 s) — 60 s leaves plenty of
headroom. The backend sets `X-Accel-Buffering: no` on the SSE response,
so nginx flushes each event immediately without further configuration.
If the proxy runs on a different host, add its IP to `TRUSTED_PROXIES`
so rate limiting uses the real client IP — see
[Rate limiting & proxies](#rate-limiting--proxies).

## Authentication & security

**websh does not include its own authentication layer by design.**
It is meant to be lightweight — add access control at the web server level:

- **Apache:** `.htaccess` with `AuthType Basic` + `AuthUserFile`
- **nginx:** `auth_basic` directive
- **Cloudflare Access**, **Tailscale Funnel**, or similar zero-trust tools
- IP allowlisting via firewall rules

### SSH host keys

The backend connects with `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` by default to avoid
interactive prompts. **This makes the first connection to any host vulnerable
to man-in-the-middle attacks** — the server identity is not verified.

This is acceptable when:
- You are connecting to your own servers on a trusted network
- The connection goes over an encrypted tunnel (VPN, Tailscale, etc.)

To enable host key verification for specific connections, use `ssh_options`
in `websh.json`:

```json
"ssh_options": {"StrictHostKeyChecking": "yes"}
```

### Saved connections & passwords

Saved connections in the browser are stored in `localStorage` **in plaintext**,
including passwords. Any JavaScript running on the same origin (including XSS
vulnerabilities) could read them.

If this is unacceptable for your use case:
- Use server-side connections (`websh.json`) — passwords stay on the server, never reach the browser
- Don't save connections in the browser — use SSH keys instead
- Restrict access to the websh URL to trusted networks

### Rate limiting & proxies

Connection attempts are rate-limited to **50 per IP per minute** by default
(configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` and `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`). The client IP is
determined from `X-Forwarded-For` **only** when the request comes from an IP
listed in `TRUSTED_PROXIES` (default: `127.0.0.1`). Direct connections always
use the TCP peer address.

**Requirement when running behind a reverse proxy:** the proxy MUST overwrite
(not append) the client-IP header before forwarding. websh reads the *first*
`X-Forwarded-For` token, so a proxy that appends (the default
`$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` recipe in many tutorials) lets a client supply
their own first token and bypass both per-IP rate limiting and the
`MAX_SESSIONS_PER_IP` cap. Use one of:

```nginx
# nginx — overwrite (good)
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
# OR use X-Real-IP, also overwrite by default:
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
```

websh validates the token via `ipaddress.ip_address()` and silently falls
back to the TCP peer if it doesn't parse, so non-IP garbage cannot end up as
the rate-limit / session-cap key — but a *valid* IP forged by an appending
proxy will still be honored. The only defense there is correct proxy config.

If your reverse proxy runs on a different host, add its IP:

```bash
TRUSTED_PROXIES=127.0.0.1,10.0.0.5 python3 server.py
```

### Access log

Set `WEBSH_ACCESS_LOG=/path/to/access.log` to emit one JSON record per
abuse-relevant event. Records are stable single-line JSON suitable for
`fail2ban` filters and ad-hoc `jq` pipelines. The value is normalised
at startup: `~` expands and a relative path resolves against the
server's cwd. The resolved path is logged once at startup
(`access log: <abs-path>`).

```json
{"ts":"2026-05-07T12:34:56.789012Z","event":"connect","ip":"203.0.113.7","result":"deny_blocked","target_host":"10.5.6.7","target_user":"root"}
{"ts":"2026-05-07T12:35:01.123456Z","event":"connect","ip":"203.0.113.7","result":"rate_limited"}
{"ts":"2026-05-07T12:35:42.999999Z","event":"connect","ip":"198.51.100.4","result":"ok","sid":"…","target_host":"prod.example","target_user":"deploy","persistent":false,"latency_ms":612}
{"ts":"2026-05-07T12:40:11.000000Z","event":"disconnect","ip":"198.51.100.4","sid":"…","terminate":false,"target_host":"prod.example","result":"closed"}
```

Common `result` values on `connect` events:

| `result` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Session created. Record includes `sid`, `target_host`, `target_user`, `persistent`, `latency_ms`. |
| `rate_limited` | Caller exceeded `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` for the window. |
| `deny_blocked` | Target host (or its resolved IP) is on `denied_hosts`. |
| `session_cap_per_ip` | The per-source-IP active session cap (`MAX_SESSIONS_PER_IP`) was at the limit. |
| `session_cap_global` | Global cap (`MAX_SESSIONS` for `foreground`, `MAX_BG_SESSIONS` for `background`) was at the limit. The `classification` field tells which. |
| `scan_pattern` | The IP has reached `SCAN_PATTERN_THRESHOLD` distinct deny-listed targets inside the window. Emitted in addition to the original `deny_blocked` record, starting on the Nth probe and on every probe after. ANY successful connect from the same IP clears state, so a power user touching many real servers never accumulates here. |
| `error` | Internal failure during session creation. The `error` field carries up to 200 Unicode characters of the exception (~800 UTF-8 bytes for non-ASCII text). |

Common `result` values on `disconnect` events:

| `result` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `closed` | Disconnect with `terminate=false`; the persistent session (if any) is left alive on the target. |
| `terminated` | Disconnect with `terminate=true`; the persistent tmux session was killed on the target before close. |
| `close_error` | `session.close()` (or `terminate_remote_tmux()`) raised. The record still appears, with `error` set to the exception text. |

`fail2ban` filter sketch — drop into `/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/websh-abuse.conf`:

```ini
[Definition]
failregex = ^.*"ip":\s*"<HOST>".*"result":\s*"(rate_limited|session_cap_per_ip|scan_pattern)".*$
ignoreregex =
```

Note that `deny_blocked` is deliberately **not** in the recommended
filter. A one-off `deny_blocked` is just as likely a fat-fingered
hostname or a stale UI link as it is an attacker — banning on a single
event would burn legitimate users. The `scan_pattern` event is the
curated signal for "this IP is probing the deny-list": it only fires
once `SCAN_PATTERN_THRESHOLD` distinct deny-listed targets are reached
inside the window, and any successful connect from the same IP
forgives the accumulation. So `deny_blocked` records stay in the log
for operator visibility (you want to see misconfigured clients) but
fail2ban acts only on the `scan_pattern` aggregate.

If `SCAN_PATTERN_THRESHOLD=0` (the default — disabled), `deny_blocked`
events are still recorded but no `scan_pattern` events are ever
emitted — the operator hasn't opted in to automatic banning, so
nothing in this filter triggers on a typo. Set a positive
`SCAN_PATTERN_THRESHOLD` to enable the curated signal.

The file is opened-and-closed per write, so `logrotate(8)` works without
any signal-based reopen plumbing — `copytruncate` is fine. Each record
is committed with a single `write(2)` on an `O_APPEND` fd: on Linux the
kernel adjusts the file offset and commits the buffer atomically against
other `O_APPEND` writers, so concurrent threads do not interleave bytes
within one record. To keep that guarantee real, every attacker-
controlled string field is hard-capped before serialisation
(`target_host` 253, `target_user` 64, `sid` 36, `error` 200, server-
controlled status fields 32) and ASCII C0/C1 + Unicode bidi/format
control codepoints are scrubbed to `?`, so a single record always fits
in one `write(2)` call and stays safe to view in a terminal.

### Input validation

- Host and username values starting with `-` are rejected (prevents SSH flag injection)
- Session IDs are validated as UUID format
- Terminal dimensions are clamped to safe ranges
- `MAX_SESSIONS` limits concurrent user sessions; `MAX_BG_SESSIONS` limits file transfer sessions separately
- `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_IP` (off by default) caps how many sessions a single source IP can hold at once — useful when running a public-facing instance where one abuser shouldn't be able to fill all the global slots

## Project structure

```
index.html                Frontend — xterm.js terminal + connection UI
websh.js                  Frontend logic — pane management, file transfer, themes
api.php                   PHP proxy — forwards browser requests to backend (optional)
server.py                 Python backend — manages SSH sessions via PTY, serves frontend
assets/                   Brand SVGs (logo light/dark variants) loaded by index.html
websh.json.example        Example server-side config
test_server.py            Backend tests (unit + integration)
tests/frontend/           jsdom-based frontend tests
docs/                     Design notes (e.g. auth-fail-detection.md, sse-transport.md)
Dockerfile                Container deployment
websh.service             systemd unit file
LICENSE                   MIT license
```

## Tests

```bash
# Backend (Python, stdlib only — unittest)
python3 test_server.py -v

# Frontend (Node 20 + jsdom)
cd tests/frontend && npm install && npm test
```

Both suites also run on every PR via GitHub Actions.
