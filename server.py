websh — lightweight SSH terminal backend.

REST API server that manages SSH sessions via PTY.
Designed to run on shared hosting with Python 3.5+, zero dependencies.
Listens on 127.0.0.1 only — meant to be proxied through Apache/nginx via PHP.

Environment variables:
    PORT                  — listen port (default: 8765)
    HOST                  — bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
    SESSION_TIMEOUT       — seconds of inactivity before cleanup (default: 300)
    MAX_SESSIONS          — max concurrent SSH sessions (default: 50)
    WEBSH_CONFIG          — path to websh.json config file (optional)
    TRUSTED_PROXIES       — comma-separated IPs to trust X-Forwarded-For from (default: 127.0.0.1)
    MAX_BG_SESSIONS       — max background SSH sessions for file transfer (default: 50)
    WEBSH_MAX_THREADS     — max concurrent HTTP worker threads; new requests
                            past this get 503 immediately (default:
                            4*(MAX_SESSIONS+MAX_BG_SESSIONS)+64 = 464)
    RATE_LIMIT_MAX        — max /api/connect attempts per IP per window (default: 50)
    RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW     — rate-limit window in seconds (default: 60)
    WEBSH_TMUX_IDLE_TTL   — seconds a detached persistent tmux session may idle
                            on the target before a watchdog kills it
                            (default: 259200 = 72h, 0 disables)
    WEBSH_TMUX_WATCHDOG_POLL
                          — seconds between watchdog checks on the target
                            (default: 300; the effective kill window is
                            TTL + POLL in the worst case, so lower this
                            when testing with a short TTL)

API endpoints:
    POST /api/connect     — start SSH session
    POST /api/input       — send keystrokes
    GET  /api/output      — long-poll for terminal output
    GET  /api/stream      — Server-Sent Events stream of terminal output
                            (low-latency alternative to /api/output; falls
                            back to long-poll if the proxy buffers it)
    POST /api/resize      — resize terminal
    POST /api/disconnect  — close session
    POST /api/upload      — stream a file body to $HOME/<path> on remote
    POST /api/upload_finalize — mv an uploaded tmp into pane cwd (persistent)
    POST /api/upload_cancel — remove a partial/staged upload tmp
    POST /api/tmux_options — push tmux options live into a persistent session
    GET  /api/tmux_capture — capture full tmux pane buffer (persistent only)
    GET  /api/config      — return server-side config (without secrets)
    GET  /api/ping        — health check

# ─── Persistent-session TTL watchdog ─────────────────────────────────
#
# Problem: if a browser closes without clicking [x], the remote tmux
# session survives detach (that's the whole point of persistent mode)
# but nothing ever reaps it. Abandoned sessions accumulate and consume
# RAM on the target host. We don't store SSH credentials on the websh
# server, so we can't reach back to clean up autonomously.
#
# Fix: at session creation, the remote command spawns a detached
# watchdog alongside the tmux session. The watchdog polls tmux and
# calls `kill-session` once the session has been unattached for longer
# than TMUX_IDLE_TTL seconds. The TTL clock is reset in two ways:
#
#   1. On every /api/connect: the orchestration shell stamps a
#      per-slot "seen" file before spawning. So any reconnect — even
#      one that predates the watchdog's next poll — resets the clock.
#   2. On every watchdog poll where a client is currently attached:
#      the watchdog refreshes the same "seen" file. Handles the case
#      where a user stays attached for longer than TTL and then
#      detaches briefly — without this, tmux's session_last_attached
#      would be stale and the session would die seconds after detach.
#
# Idempotency across reconnects is via a pidfile (`kill -0 "$PID"`).
# Stale pidfiles (dead PID) are silently overwritten by the new
# watchdog.

# How often the watchdog polls (seconds). Resolution of the TTL kill
# is therefore TTL + WATCHDOG_POLL_SECONDS in the worst case. Clamped
# to >=5 so a misconfigured 0 can't busy-loop the target.
WATCHDOG_POLL_SECONDS = max(5, _int_env("WEBSH_TMUX_WATCHDOG_POLL", "300"))

# Idle TTL for detached tmux sessions on the target (seconds).
# 0 disables the watchdog — sessions live forever as before.

# When unset (default), the helper is a no-op and the request flow is

# Each record is emitted with a single os.write(2) on an O_APPEND fd
# opened-and-closed per call. logrotate(8) survives without any signal-
# based reopen plumbing — `copytruncate` is fine. On Linux, O_APPEND
# adjusts the file offset and writes the buffer atomically with respect
# to other O_APPEND writers, so concurrent threads cannot interleave
# bytes. To keep that guarantee real (rather than depending on PIPE_BUF
# or per-syscall partial-write quirks), every attacker-controlled string
# field is hard-capped before serialisation, which keeps the final JSON
# line safely under any reasonable single-write limit.

    """Threaded HTTP server with a hard cap on concurrent workers.

    Drop-in replacement for socketserver.ThreadingMixIn+HTTPServer. The
    plain mixin spawns a thread per request without limit; under a
    glitchy client that reconnects /api/stream in a tight loop, or a
    coordinated DoS, the thread count would explode before any of the
    session/IP caps trigger.

    We hold a BoundedSemaphore sized to WEBSH_MAX_THREADS (env). The
    semaphore is acquired non-blocking in process_request; if it's
    exhausted the request gets an immediate 503 and the socket is shut
    down — better than queuing, which would create the same back-pressure
    failure mode with a longer fuse. Worker slot is released in a finally
    so a handler exception can't leak it.

    Permit-leak defences:
      - process_request wraps Thread()+start() in try/except so a spawn
        failure (RuntimeError "can't start new thread", MemoryError under
        the OS thread cap) releases the just-acquired permit before
        propagating the error. Without this, repeated spawn failures
        would silently drain capacity to zero — every subsequent request
        would get 503 forever, requiring a restart.
      - _run_under_semaphore makes release() the *last* operation in
        the worker (ordered after shutdown_request) and wraps every
        prior step in its own try/except. Even a misbehaving handler
        or a shutdown_request that throws cannot prevent the permit
        from being returned.
