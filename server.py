"""
websh — lightweight SSH terminal backend.

REST API server that manages SSH sessions via PTY.
Designed to run on shared hosting with Python 3.5+, zero dependencies.
Listens on 127.0.0.1 only — meant to be proxied through Apache/nginx via PHP.

Environment variables:
    PORT                  — listen port (default: 8765)
    HOST                  — bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
    SESSION_TIMEOUT       — seconds of inactivity before cleanup (default: 300)
    MAX_SESSIONS          — max concurrent SSH sessions (default: 50)
    WEBSH_CONFIG          — path to websh.json config file (optional)
    TRUSTED_PROXIES       — comma-separated IPs to trust X-Forwarded-For from (default: 127.0.0.1)
    MAX_BG_SESSIONS       — max background SSH sessions for file transfer (default: 50)
    WEBSH_MAX_THREADS     — max concurrent HTTP worker threads; new requests
                            past this get 503 immediately (default:
                            4*(MAX_SESSIONS+MAX_BG_SESSIONS)+64 = 464)
    RATE_LIMIT_MAX        — max /api/connect attempts per IP per window (default: 50)
    RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW     — rate-limit window in seconds (default: 60)
    WEBSH_TMUX_IDLE_TTL   — seconds a detached persistent tmux session may idle
                            on the target before a watchdog kills it
                            (default: 259200 = 72h, 0 disables)
    WEBSH_TMUX_WATCHDOG_POLL
                          — seconds between watchdog checks on the target
                            (default: 300; the effective kill window is
                            TTL + POLL in the worst case, so lower this
                            when testing with a short TTL)

API endpoints:
    POST /api/connect     — start SSH session
    POST /api/input       — send keystrokes
    GET  /api/output      — long-poll for terminal output
    GET  /api/stream      — Server-Sent Events stream of terminal output
                            (low-latency alternative to /api/output; falls
                            back to long-poll if the proxy buffers it)
    POST /api/resize      — resize terminal
    POST /api/disconnect  — close session
    POST /api/upload      — stream a file body to $HOME/<path> on remote
    POST /api/upload_finalize — mv an uploaded tmp into pane cwd (persistent)
    POST /api/upload_cancel — remove a partial/staged upload tmp
    POST /api/tmux_options — push tmux options live into a persistent session
    GET  /api/tmux_capture — capture full tmux pane buffer (persistent only)
    GET  /api/config      — return server-side config (without secrets)
    GET  /api/ping        — health check

# ─── Persistent-session TTL watchdog ─────────────────────────────────
#
# Problem: if a browser closes without clicking [x], the remote tmux
# session survives detach (that's the whole point of persistent mode)
# but nothing ever reaps it. Abandoned sessions accumulate and consume
# RAM on the target host. We don't store SSH credentials on the websh
# server, so we can't reach back to clean up autonomously.
#
# Fix: at session creation, the remote command spawns a detached
# watchdog alongside the tmux session. The watchdog polls tmux and
# calls `kill-session` once the session has been unattached for longer
# than TMUX_IDLE_TTL seconds. The TTL clock is reset in two ways:
#
#   1. On every /api/connect: the orchestration shell stamps a
#      per-slot "seen" file before spawning. So any reconnect — even
#      one that predates the watchdog's next poll — resets the clock.
#   2. On every watchdog poll where a client is currently attached:
#      the watchdog refreshes the same "seen" file. Handles the case
#      where a user stays attached for longer than TTL and then
#      detaches briefly — without this, tmux's session_last_attached
#      would be stale and the session would die seconds after detach.
#
# Idempotency across reconnects is via a pidfile (`kill -0 "$PID"`).
# Stale pidfiles (dead PID) are silently overwritten by the new
# watchdog.

# How often the watchdog polls (seconds). Resolution of the TTL kill
# is therefore TTL + WATCHDOG_POLL_SECONDS in the worst case. Clamped
# to >=5 so a misconfigured 0 can't busy-loop the target.
WATCHDOG_POLL_SECONDS = max(5, _int_env("WEBSH_TMUX_WATCHDOG_POLL", "300"))

# Idle TTL for detached tmux sessions on the target (seconds).
# 0 disables the watchdog — sessions live forever as before.

#      legitimate user typing the wrong password just has auth fail
#      against ONE target — no scan pattern. A power user pinging 50
#      real servers gets through the deny-list (those hosts are
#      public) so nothing accumulates. Only an attacker probing
#      RFC1918 / loopback / our own infra keeps tripping deny_blocked.
#   2. *Any* successful connect from the same IP clears the IP's
#      accumulated state. So even if a power user's session crashes
#      and they retry against a typoed-into-RFC1918 hostname once or
#      twice, their next successful login forgives them. A scanner
